## Language / compiler gaps

- [ ] **Source locations, debug info, and LSP foundation** — current diagnostics map some expanded lines back through the preprocessor, but AST nodes lack a unified file/start/end span and generated C has no source-aware `#line` directives. Plan: `doc/source_locations_debug_lsp_plan.md`. First ship shared SourceSpan/source mapping and `#line` diagnostics; then Clang `-g`/`-O0` debug builds and a versioned `.ov.map`; finally use the same locations for LSP and debugger adapters. LSP syntax/diagnostics can start directly from AST before native debugging is complete.
- [x] **Generic class-method return instantiation (single TU)** — `[Box<NPString *> defaultValue]`
  substitutes T in the checker's result type and in the specialized vtable fn-ptr casts;
  ARC ownership on the returned T is correct (no extra release at the call site).
  Evidence: `probes/genret/` g1 (multi-instantiation), g3 (function pointers), g4 (ARC).
- [x] **Generic class-method return across TUs** — a multi-input build now collects
  concrete specializations from all `.ov` inputs and forwards the demand to the TU
  containing the generic implementation, so `[Factory<NPString *> make]` no longer
  needs a dummy variable in the library TU. This remains true monomorphization: the
  generated class, methods, vtable, metadata, and ABI are specialized per argument
  list. A separately precompiled library can only provide the specializations it
  shipped; it cannot invent a new method body for an unseen type. See `probes/genret/g2/`
  and the cross-TU generic section in `README.md` / `CHINESE.md`.
- [x] **Categories across TUs** — implemented (weak-definition/strong-extern vtable slots, ownership excluded for category impls); see `doc/categories_protocol_plan.md` §8 and `tests/multi_tu/14`/`15`.
- [x] **Protocol inheritance across TUs** — implemented: weak-coalesced `NPProtocol` identity, static metadata + `conformsToProtocol:` runtime query. Category-only conformances are merged by a constructor registration path (`tests/multi_tu/16_category_protocol`).
- [ ] **Pattern switch M2** — mixing plain constant arms with pattern arms in one `switch` (currently rejected with a clear error); exhaustiveness analysis.

## Foundation library gaps

- [x] **Container classes** — `NPSet` / `NPMutableSet` / `NPOrderedSet` exist
  (isEqual: value semantics, insertion order preserved by NPOrderedSet;
  mutator slots live on NPSet so the subclass vtables resolve — see the
  notes in `NPSet.oh`).
- [x] **`NPPredicate`** (the `NSPredicate` model) — shipped: a runtime
  format-string parser + evaluation engine (`NPPredicate.ov`), compile-time KVC
  accessor tables (`OVIC_KVC_$_X`, see `doc/architecture.md` §12) and the host
  filtering API (`filteredArrayUsingPredicate:` /
  `indexOfObjectMatchingPredicate:` / `filterUsingPredicate:`; a `nil`
  predicate is the identity). Covered by `tests/predicate_filter_test.ov` and
  `tests/multi_tu/13_kvc_predicate`. Block-based filtering
  (`indexesOfObjectsPassingTest:`) stays a valid alternative for one-off tests.
- [ ] **Variadic convenience constructors** — only `arrayWithObjects:count:`-style signatures exist; the variadic `initWithObjects:..., nil` form is not declared. Related known quirk: `[NPMutableArray arrayWithObjects:...]` desugars to the immutable array path.
- [ ] **`NSAssert`** macro is absent.
- [ ] **Object subscripting on dictionaries** — `d[@"k"]` is deliberately not wired (`objectForKeyedSubscript:` undeclared); the checker's subscript rewrite only knows `objectAtIndex:`.
- [x] **`conformsToProtocol:` runtime** — class metadata now carries a populated protocol table and the runtime query walks class + protocol parent chains (`doc/categories_protocol_plan.md` §8).

## EH known limitations (accepted, not scheduled)

- **`-eh legacy` (sjlj)**: a cross-function `@throw` skips scope-end releases in intermediate frames (leak). The default `checked` backend does not have this issue.
- **Bare generics are a warning, not an error**: bare container spellings (`NPArray` without type args) keep erased-compat behavior; use explicit type args for element-type checking.

## Checker known limitations (accepted, not scheduled)

- **Undeclared selector is a warning, not an error** — receiver-type resolution is unreliable under the self-contained umbrella (e.g. `[other count]` inside `NPMutableArray.ov` misresolves `NPArray *` as `NPString *`), so an error would break Foundation itself. Consequence: calling an undeclared selector on a statically typed receiver still segfaults at runtime (NULL vtable slot); the warning is the only compile-time guard.

## Tooling

- [ ] **Windows native validation** — `ovicc.exe` builds and cross-compiles, but runtime behavior on real Windows is untested (zig cc backend, `__thread` semantics).
