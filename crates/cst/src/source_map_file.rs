//! Sidecar source-map file (`.ov.map`) — the versioned JSON schema of 阶段 4
//! (`doc/source_locations_debug_lsp_plan.md` lines 66-74).
//!
//! The file maps **generated C lines** back to **Ovel source lines**. Its
//! ground truth is the `#line` directive stream in the generated C, which is
//! exactly what the C preprocessor consumes, so the map can never disagree
//! with what clang diagnostics show. Within one mapping the source line
//! increments by one per generated C line (CPP `#line` semantics), so a
//! mapping covering N C lines starting at `src_line_start` spans source lines
//! `src_line_start ..= src_line_start + N - 1` (stored as `src_line_end`).
//!
//! Schema (version 1):
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "version": 1,
//!   "generator": "ovelc",
//!   "primary_source": "main.ov",
//!   "generated": { "path": "main.c", "hash": "fnv1a64:…" },
//!   "sources": [ { "id": 0, "path": "main.ov", "hash": "fnv1a64:…" } ],
//!   "mappings": [
//!     { "c_start": 120, "c_end": 480,
//!       "c_start_line": 9, "c_start_col": 1, "c_end_line": 11, "c_end_col": 14,
//!       "src_id": 0, "src_line_start": 3, "src_line_end": 5,
//!       "kind": "source", "synthetic": false }
//!   ]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! - `sources[]` — every file named by a `#line` directive (a TU may inline
//!   many). `id` is this file's own stable identifier: sources are sorted by
//!   path so the same build always assigns the same ids.
//! - `generated.hash` / `sources[].hash` — FNV-1a 64 content hashes. A
//!   consumer compares the generated-C hash before trusting the map; a stale
//!   map next to a new `.c` is thereby detected (plan: build identity).
//!   `hash_algo` is spelled inside the value (`fnv1a64:<hex>`) so a future
//!   stronger hash can coexist.
//! - Synthetic regions (compiler-generated code attributed to no source
//!   file) omit `src_id` / `src_line_start` / `src_line_end` entirely and
//!   carry `"synthetic": true`, `"kind": "synthetic"`.
//! - Lines before the first `#line` directive are not mapped at all.
//! - `kind` names the generation category; version 1 only ever emits
//!   `"source"` / `"synthetic"` (later phases add ARC/EH/pattern/async kinds
//!   — the field is a plain string so consumers must treat unknown kinds as
//!   synthetic-ish and keep parsing).
//!
//! JSON is written by hand: `ovel-cst` is intentionally dependency-free and
//! this schema is write-only for the compiler (the reader lives in the
//! future LSP/debugger-adapter consumers, 阶段 6).
//!
//! Paths are stored exactly as emitted into the `#line` directives; on
//! Windows a backslash is JSON-escaped (`\\`), which is valid JSON and
//! round-trips.
