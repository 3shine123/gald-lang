# run_strong_metadata_test.sh — protection tests for class-metadata linkage.
#
# Guards the precompiled-library (P3) contract from doc/stable_slots_plan.md §8
# on three levels, because "the program printed the right thing" alone does not
# prove the metadata linkage is right:
#
#   1. OBJECT FILE — the library's class metadata is actually STRONG
#      (nm), not merely weak-merged by luck. Reuses tools/build-foundation-lib.sh,
#      which also enforces this.
#   2. LINK + RUN  — a client TU that only sees declarations (weak stubs) links
#      against the strong library and runs correctly.
#   3. LOUD FAILURE — the deleted -fstrong-metadata spelling is rejected with
#      "Unknown argument": plan A removed the manual switch, so a legacy
#      script still carrying it must fail loudly instead of half-working.
#      (Duplicate-symbol loudness for two owners lives in check 4; against
#      the per-TU *archive* a client re-implementation is standard C override
#      semantics — the library member stays dormant unless referenced.)
#   4. R2 OWNERSHIP — two TUs that both `@implementation` the same class are
#      both owners and must be a duplicate symbol (no flag involved).
#   5. AUTO-STRONG — the flag is NOT required for the standalone-TU workflow:
#      a main file (.jth or .jeti) holding an `@implementation` emits STRONG
#      metadata for its owned class with no flag at all (ownership is derived
#      from the main file). Guards the rule from regressing into
#      "must remember -fstrong-metadata by hand".
#   6. CLIENT STAYS WEAK — a declaration-only `.jth` (no @implementation
#      reaching the TU) must NOT go strong: its stubs are the client side of
#      rule R2 and must lose to the owner's table.
#
# Out-of-band (like tests/multi_tu): not part of test_all.py.
